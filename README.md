=======================

No rules, no restrictions, anything goes, learn as you go, and try not to kill anyone.


Things to Know
--------------

The default branch is: `gh-pages`.  This means everything that goes into the repo can be accessed over http through:

* http://kirupa-racquet-club.github.io/kirupa-tennis-free-play/

If you're new to git, a pretty good resource is:

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/315911/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide

There's a lot to digest, but you can find something basic to start from in the list there (or find something that fits your comfort level of learning).
